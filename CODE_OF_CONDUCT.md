# Code of Conduct

If you're interacting in Discord, codebases, mailing lists, events, or any other Qwery activity, you must follow the Code of Conduct. Please review it before getting started.

## Our Pledge

Qwery seeks to foster an open and welcoming environment. Contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the project and the community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what's best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which someone could reasonably consider inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that aren't aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [conduct@qwery.run](mailto:conduct@qwery.run). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who don't follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Discord Community Guidelines

Qwery's Discord community is a space for data professionals to collaborate and learn. Please follow these guidelines to maintain a welcoming environment:

### Be respectful

Qwery takes respect seriously. While the occasional breach of etiquette is forgivable, disrespectful behavior is not condoned.

### Use the right channels

Use topic-specific channels so members can opt-in on conversations. Post in the most relevant channel and respect channel-specific reminders.

### Don't double-post

Be considerate of community members' time. Check if your question has been asked before. Discord is a community of volunteers, not a customer service platform.

### Ask thoughtful questions

Our members are knowledgeable and willing to help for free. Well-researched, thoughtful questions show consideration for their time.

### Keep it public

Do not contact individual members without their express permission. This is a public forum.

### No soliciting

This community is for anyone working with data to discuss their work and share ideas—not for generating leads or recruiting.

### Use threads

Keep conversations organized by using threads for discussions and follow-ups.

## Report Violations

If you see a message or receive a direct message that violates any of these rules, please contact a Qwery team member at [conduct@qwery.run](mailto:conduct@qwery.run). We'll take appropriate moderation action immediately. Qwery has zero tolerance for intentional rule-breaking and hate speech.
