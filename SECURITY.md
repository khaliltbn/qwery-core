## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Qwery team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**[security@qwery.run](mailto:security@qwery.run)**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: We will provide a detailed response within 7 days, including next steps
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will coordinate with you on public disclosure timing

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service interruption
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not exploit a security issue beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it
- Provide us a reasonable time to resolve issues before public disclosure
- Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others

### Recognition

We maintain a security hall of fame to recognize researchers who have helped keep Qwery secure. If you'd like to be credited for your discovery (after the issue is resolved), please let us know in your report.
